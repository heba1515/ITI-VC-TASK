1. What is a pull request and a request, and the difference between them?
A pull request is a feature in Git-based collaboration platforms like GitHub that allows a contributor to propose changes to a repository. It is often used in team workflows where contributors request to merge their feature or branch into another branch, typically the main branch. Pull requests also facilitate code review and discussion.

git checkout dept
git rebase main

git fetch origin
git log origin/main

6. What is the command to show the differences between the current branch and the branch "new-email"?
git diff new-email
